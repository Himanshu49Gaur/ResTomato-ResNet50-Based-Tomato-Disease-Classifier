## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The model is based on **ResNet50**, a powerful pre-trained convolutional neural network from ImageNet. The top layer is replaced with:

- GlobalAveragePooling
- Dense layer with ReLU activation
- Output layer with Softmax for classification

> Fine-tuned with data augmentation and early stopping to avoid overfitting.

---

## üìä Results

- **Accuracy**: Achieved >90% accuracy on validation set.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Highlights performance across all disease classes.
- **Training Curves**: Visualizations for loss and accuracy.
- **Model Robustness**: Generalizes well due to data augmentation.

---

## üß† Explainability

The model‚Äôs predictions can be interpreted using **LIME**, which generates a heatmap of the most influential pixels in the prediction decision.

- Helps build trust in the AI system.
- Useful for debugging model errors.
